<b>How it works</b>
<ol>The code connects to your network using the WiFi library.
<li>It initializes the WiFi sniffer using the wifi_sniffer_init() function.</li>
<li>In the loop() function, it sniffs network packets using the wifi_sniffer_get_packet() function.</li>
<li>If a packet is received, it analyzes the packet using the analyzePacket() function.</li>
<li>If the packet is a TCP packet and an HTTP request, it extracts the URL from the packet payload (not implemented in this example).</li>
<li>It prints the device IP, URL, and other relevant information to the serial console.</li>
</ol>
  <b>Note</b>
This code is just a starting point, and you'll need to implement the getUrlFromPacket() function to extract the URL from the packet payload. Additionally, this code may not work for all types of network traffic, and you may need to modify it to suit your specific requirements.

Please ensure you have the necessary permissions and follow applicable laws and regulations when monitoring network traffic.
